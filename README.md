## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes a **Bike Buyers dataset** using Microsoft Excel to uncover patterns in customer demographics and their bike purchasing behavior.  
The workflow includes **data cleaning, transformation, pivot table analysis, and dashboard visualization**.

## 🛠 Steps Performed  

### 1. **Raw Data Import (bike_buyers sheet)**  
- Imported customer dataset containing attributes such as:  
  - Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Ownership, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and Bike Purchase status.  
- Identified issues: duplicate columns, inconsistent categorical codes, and income stored as text.  

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation (Working Sheet)**  
- Converted categorical codes:  
  - `M/F → Male/Female`  
  - `M/S → Married/Single`  
- Cleaned **Income** column (e.g., `"$40,000"` → `40000`).  
- Removed duplicate **Purchased Bike** column.  
- Created **Age Brackets** (`Young`, `Middle Aged`, `Old`) for better analysis.  

### 3. **Data Analysis (Pivot Table Sheet)**  
- Built pivot tables to explore:  
  - **Average income vs bike purchase by gender**.  
  - Purchasing trends across **age groups, regions, and commute distances**.  
- Identified key trends and correlations.  

### 4. **Visualization (Dashboard Sheet)**  
- Created an interactive Excel dashboard with:  
  - Charts visualizing **purchase patterns by age, gender, and income**.  
  - Slicers for filtering data dynamically.  
- Delivered insights in a clear and professional format.
